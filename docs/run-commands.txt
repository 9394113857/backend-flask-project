Start-Process "chrome" "http://127.0.0.1:5000"; flask run

===============================================

# Starts a new PowerShell process, waits for 3 seconds, then opens Chrome at http://127.0.0.1:5000, and starts the Flask server to serve the app, all in the background.
Start-Process powershell -ArgumentList "Start-Sleep -Seconds 3; Start-Process chrome http://127.0.0.1:5000; flask run"


Explanation in the comment:
Starts a new PowerShell process (Start-Process powershell).

Waits for 3 seconds (Start-Sleep -Seconds 3).

Launches Chrome and opens http://127.0.0.1:5000 (Start-Process chrome http://127.0.0.1:5000).

Starts the Flask server to serve your application (flask run).

How the processes work:
The PowerShell process runs the entire sequence.

In the background, Chrome is launched after the delay, and Flask starts the server, making everything work together!

This comment should clarify the entire flow in a single line. You can paste this into your PowerShell script to document what the command does.
