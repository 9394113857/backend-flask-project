# Update pip to the latest version
python -m pip install --upgrade pip  # This updates pip to the newest version

# Run a Flask application (assuming the app is in the current directory)
flask run  # Starts the Flask web server


=================================================

Explanation:
1.	python -m pip install --upgrade pip: This updates the pip package manager to the latest version.
2.	flask run: This starts the Flask web application, assuming Flask is installed and thereâ€™s a app.py or similar file in your directory.

Things to note in VSCode with PowerShell:
1.	Ensure you're in the correct Python environment where Flask is installed (you can use a virtual environment if needed).
2.	If you haven't set up Flask yet, you'll need to install it first by running pip install flask in the terminal.
